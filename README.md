# Footprint Recognition based on Time-Series Classification

## Project of EE6563 (2021/04/20)



Given present-day security concerns, many buildings have implemented robust authentication techniques.
Aside from authentication to enter a building, applications such as border and airport
security also administer identification. Therefore, many cities and companies provide technologies
like CCTV or fingerprinting for authentication and verification. But each system has its own drawbacks.
For example, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most people wear a mask and avoid touching
unnecessary surfaces. Thus, gait recognition could be a solution.
In this paper, we present a review of the time series approaches for classification tasks including
conventional machine learning algorithms and Deep Neural Networks. These approaches were
implemented in verification mode. Experimental results show that the SVM classifier on the contribution
of all handcrafted features had the best performance with 91.3%.
