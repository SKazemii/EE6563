\section{Discussion Progress}

The results indicate that spectral features are more powerful features for all machine learning algorithms. The reason behind this might be the number of features in this set. Based on table \ref{tab:Features_list}, there are about 300 features for this set, much more than two others.

Another feature that has a significant effect on the accuracy is inter stride distance. This feature has been added only to all features and increased the accuracy of LDA from 60\% to 69\%. 
 
The results might suggest that using AR features are not significant impact on accuracy. The accuracy of LDA without these features reduced to 68.57\%. 

Since we used one window for extracting temporal and statistical features, these results are not reliable for the quality of these two sets. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that the times-series signals were included many zeros due to the fact that videos were not normalized in the time axis. Thus, these zeros could bring a negative impact on temporal and statistical features.
