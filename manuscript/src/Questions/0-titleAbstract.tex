\begin{abstract}
Given present-day security concerns, many buildings have implemented robust authentication techniques. Aside from authentication to enter a building, applications such as border and airport security also administer identification. Therefore, many cities and companies provide technologies like CCTV or fingerprinting for authentication and verification. But each system has its own drawbacks. For example, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most people wear a mask and avoid touching unnecessary surfaces. Thus, gait recognition could be a solution. In this project, we worked on temporal information of time-series data. These features used to construct a classifier. Moreover, verification mode was used for this research.

%This aids to disguise people and reduces the hygiene of fingerprint biometrics respectively. In this research, we focus on which classifier has better results on barefoot footprints and which features have the important effect on the classifier.
