\item \textbf{Separate the  various  activities  and  visualize  the  data  for  the  different  classes.  Next,  explore  using HMM  state  modeling  for  each activity (‘Standing  Up,  Walking  and  Going  up-down  stairs’)  by breaking  the activity into different states (for example 3 states, one for ‘Standing Up’  ,  a second for ‘Walking’  and a third  for  ‘Going  up-down  stairs’).  Analyze  the  results  of fitting  the  model  for different  HMM  states  by visual  inspection  (since  no  ground  truths  are available for where  a  sub-activity  starts  and  ends).  Generate  these  qualitative  results  for  state  decoding  when training  on  users 1-10, and testing  on users 11-15.}
